# Iris Flower Classification
In this project we will be using the popular Iris flower dataset introduced by Sir Ronald Fisher in the 1936 as an example of discriminant analysis.
The data set consists of 50 samples from each of three species of Iris (Iris setosa, Iris virginica and Iris versicolor), so 150 total samples. Four features were measured from each sample: the length and the width of the sepals and petals, in centimeters.

Now using Support Vector Machine algorithm we will perform classifcation on this data. Although it can be noticed that the result after execution of SVM model were pretty good but, in order to achieve even better results we will be tuning the paramaters with the help of Grid Search.
After finding the best parameters we will run the model again and complete it.
