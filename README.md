# Iris Flower Classification
In this project, we will be using the popular Iris flower dataset introduced by Sir Ronald Fisher in 1936 as an example of discriminant analysis.
The data set consists of 50 samples from each of three species of Iris (Iris setosa, Iris virginica, and Iris versicolor), so 150 total samples. Four features were measured from each sample: the length and the width of the sepals and petals, in centimeters.

Now using the Support Vector Machine algorithm we will perform classification on this data. Although it can be noticed that the result after execution of the SVM model was pretty good but, to achieve even better results we will be tuning the parameters with the help of Grid Search.
After finding the best parameters we will run the model again and complete it.
